   <h1>Automation Testing</h1>
   <p>Automation testing is a software testing technique that uses specialized tools and scripts to execute test cases automatically, reducing the need for manual intervention. It aims to improve the efficiency, accuracy, and speed of the testing process by automating repetitive and time-consuming tasks. With automation, testers can quickly verify the functionality, performance, and reliability of an application across multiple environments and platforms. This approach is particularly beneficial for regression testing, load testing, and continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines, as it ensures consistent and reliable results. By minimizing human error, automation testing helps improve overall software quality, while freeing up time for testers to focus on more complex, exploratory tasks.</p>
